# Example GitHub Actions contexts

This directory contains example dumps of GitHub Actions
[contexts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts).
The purpose is to understand precisely what the inputs to a GitHub Actions
workflow are, for the purposes of generating
[SLSA Provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance).

## Description

In this example, there are two levels of workflows:

-   The [top-level workflow](../../.github/workflows/dump.yaml) from this repo:
    -   Has two optional input parameters (`inputs`):
        -   `toplevelInput` (unique)
        -   `shadowedInput` (same name as reusable workflow's)
    -   Has two repo-level variables ([setting](https://github.com/MarkLodato/example-build/settings/variables/actions), [screenshot](top_level_vars.png), [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)):
        -   `TOPLEVEL_VAR` (unique)
        -   `SHADOWED_VAR` (same name as reusable workflow repo's)
    -   Dumps all contexts as a JSON object.
    -   Calls the reusable workflow below setting both of its inputs.
-   The [reusable workflow](https://github.com/MarkLodato/example-reusable-workflow/blob/main/.github/workflows/dump.yaml):
    -   Has two optional input paramters (`inputs`):
        -   `resuableInput` (unique)
        -   `shadowedInput` (same name as top-level workflow's)
    -   Has two repo-level variables ([setting](https://github.com/MarkLodato/example-reusable-workflow/settings/variables/actions), [screenshot](reusable_vars.png), [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)):
        -   `REUSABLE_VAR` (unique)
        -   `SHADOWED_VAR` (same name as reusable workflow repo's)
    -   Dumps all contexts as a JSON object.

## Instructions to reproduce

-   Go to https://github.com/MarkLodato/example-build/actions/workflows/dump.yaml
-   Execute the workflow ([screenshot](run.png)):
    -   Click **Run workflow**
    -   Set values for the two fields
    -   Click **Run workflow**
-   When it's finished go to the workflow, then copy the output of the two
    `dump-contexts` outputs.

## Example output

The following names correspond to the event type that triggered them:

-   [deployment.json](deployment.json) (no parameters specified)
    -   `gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"
        /repos/MarkLodato/example-build/deployments -f ref='refs/heads/main'`
-   [push.json](push.json)
-   [release-noparams.json](release-noparams.json) (no parameters passed in)
    -   `gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"
        /repos/MarkLodato/example-build/releases -f tag_name="v0.0.2"`
-   [release-params.json](release-noparams.json) (parameters passed in)
    -   `gh api --method POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json"
        /repos/MarkLodato/example-build/releases -f tag_name='v0.0.1' -f
        target_commitish='main' -f name='release- v1.0.0' -f body='Description
        of the release' -F draft=false -F prerelease=false -F
        generate_release_notes=true -F
        discussion_category_namestring=discussion-category`
-   [workflow_call.json](workflow_call.json) (same run as
    workflow_dispatch.json, but the reusable workflow that was called)
-   [workflow_dispatch.json](workflow_dispatch.json)

## Noteworthy properties

-   The reusable workflow's `inputs` context is a **combination** of the top-level
    inputs plus the reusable workflow inputs. In the case where both have the
    same name (`shadowedInput`), the reusable workflow's value is used.
-   The resuable workflow's `vars` context is the **same as the top-level's**
    `vars` context. In other words, the repository variables come from the
    top-level repo, not the reusable workflow's repo.

## Test for `@` symbols

The `workflow_ref` contains an `@` as a separator. This makes it difficult to
parse if the workflow name and/or ref also contain an `@`. See
[at_symbol.json](at_symbol.json) for an example:

```json
"workflow_ref": "MarkLodato/example-build/.github/workflows/at@symbol.yaml@refs/heads/branch@symbol",
```

Note that the repository name cannot contain `@`, so the SPDX Download Location
is unambiguous: the repository URL is up to the first `@`.
